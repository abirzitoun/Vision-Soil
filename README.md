# VisionSoil üå±  
A cutting-edge smart agriculture system integrating robotics, AI, embedded systems, and cross-platform interfaces.

## Overview  
**VisionSoil** is an innovative project developed as part of an academic initiative at **Esprit School of Engineering**.  
It aims to revolutionize modern agriculture by leveraging **artificial intelligence**, **robotics**to automate crop monitoring and smart irrigation through interconnected modules.

## Features  
- üîß **Multi-platform system**: mobile app (real-time monitoring + control), web platform, embedded STM32 board, AI-based analysis.
- ü§ñ **Two autonomous robots**: one for environmental monitoring and video streaming, one for targeted irrigation.
- üì± **Mobile App**:  
  - Real-time display of temperature, humidity, pressure, pH, wind speed.  
  - Navigation control of the main robot.  
  - Watering calendar + SMS confirmation system.  
  - Live video stream of robot activity.
- üíª **Web Platform**:
  - Real-time sensor dashboard.  
  - PDF report generation.  
  - Role-based access (farmer, engineer, admin).  
  - Secure authentication.
- üß† **Artificial Intelligence**:  
  - Leaf analysis for disease detection .  
  - Fruit detection and count.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Embedded System**:
  - Based on **STM32F407VG** with integrated pH, temperature, wind sensors.  
  - Transmits data to the web and mobile platforms.
- üöú **Smart Irrigation Robot**:
  - Bluetooth-based moisture detection near plants.  
  - **Arduino Mega**-controlled water pump system.  
  - Color detection for target identification.  
  - Autonomous watering and return-to-base mechanism.
